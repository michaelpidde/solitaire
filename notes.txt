Test scenarios:

- First card from deck is moved to drawnCards. It's an Ace, and is moved to pile.

- At least 3 cards are in drawnCards (thus rendered). Two of the cards are moved to piles or stacks in succession.

- All cards in drawnCards played.

-- Multiple cards in same stack promoted to piles or moved to other stacks.

-- Card is moved from pile back to stack - it cannot be re-promoted to pile (probably state problem);
